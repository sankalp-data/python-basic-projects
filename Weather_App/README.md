This project was made while learning about:
 - **APIs**(Application Programming Interface)
 - How to use **API** keys
 - Making requests using the requests module
 - Parsing JSON data
 - Basic error handling

# 📌 How to Use

1. Create an account at **OpenWeatherMap**

2. Get your **API** key

3. Run the script and enter a city name
