This is a basic Python program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer input by the user.

# How it works

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.

2. The program:

 - Shows an error if the number is negative.

 - Returns 1 if the number is 0 or 1.

 - Calculates the factorial using a for loop for other positive integers.


# How To Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).

2. Save the code in a file named factorial_for_loop.py.

3. Open a terminal and run 
    
 - python factorial_for_loop.py

4. Enter a valid number when prompted.


# Concepts Used

 - Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)

 - Looping (for)

 - Input handling with input()

 - Type conversion with int()

 - String formatting using f-strings
