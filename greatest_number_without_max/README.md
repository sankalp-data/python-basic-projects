This is a basic Python program that takes user input to build a list of numbers and then finds the maximum (greatest) number from that list manually, without using built-in functions like max().

# Program Objective

 - Allow the user to enter any number of elements to create a list.

 - Manually iterate through the list using a for loop.

 - Determine and display the greatest number in the list.


# How the Program Works

1. The user is asked how many elements they want in the list.

2. The user inputs that many integers one by one.

3. The program stores the values in a list.

4. It then:

 - Assumes the first element is the maximum.

 - Iterates through the rest of the list.

 - Updates the maximum if it finds a greater number.

5. Finally, it prints the greatest number found.


# How to Run the Script

1. Save the code in a file called greatest_number_without_max.py.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Run the script using Python:

 - python greatest_number_without_max.py


# Concepts Used

 - Lists and append() method

 - for loops

 - Comparison logic

 - Index-based access

 - User input with int(input(...))
