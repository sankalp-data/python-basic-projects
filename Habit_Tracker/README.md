#  Habit Tracker (Python CLI App)

A simple yet powerful console-based Habit Tracker built in Python to help you build and maintain daily habits.

It stores habit progress date-wise in a JSON file and gives you a visual overview of your progress through a calendar view and progress bar.

üìå **Features:**

 - Add one or more habits for today
 - Mark habits as completed
 - View calendar with ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for each day
 - Edit or delete specific habits
 - See overall completion percentage
 - View visual progress bar for a month
 - Stores data in a readable JSON format
 - Fully works offline



üìÅ **Data Format (JSON):**
```json
{
  "2025-07-21": ["Workout", "Read"],
  "2025-07-22": ["Meditate"]
} 
```

# Developer Notes

 - The view_calendar() function was the most challenging part and was built with some help to handle alignment and date logic correctly using the calendar module.

 - All other logic was written by me as part of my learning journey.

 - I plan to increase the readability and modularity of the code in future updates.
