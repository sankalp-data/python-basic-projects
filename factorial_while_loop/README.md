This Python program calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using a while loop. It performs basic input validation and handles edge cases like 0 and 1 efficiently.

# How the program works

1. The user is prompted to enter a number.

2. The program checks:

 - If the number is negative → it prints an invalid message.

 - If the number is 0 or 1 → it prints 1 directly (since 0! = 1! = 1).

3. therwise, it calculates the factorial using a while loop.


# How to Run the Script

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.

2. Save the code into a file named factorial_while_loop.py.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the script with:

 - python factorial_while_loop.py

5. Enter a number when prompted.


# Concepts Used

 - Input validation

 - Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

 - Loops (while)

 - Type conversion (int)

 - Multiplicative accumulation (fac *= i)
